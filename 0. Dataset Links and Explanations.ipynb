    "\n",
    "In the development of my book recommender system, a key component was to source contemporary and popular books to ensure our recommendations are timely and relevant. To achieve this, I utilized web scraping techniques to collect data on the top 100 best books published during the year 2023 from the Goodreads website. Goodreads is a well-known platform where readers can find new books, read reviews, and see what's trending in the literary world. By focusing on books published in the current year, we maintain the freshness of our recommendation pool, offering users titles that are current and possibly in high demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The web scraping process was carefully designed to adhere to the website's terms of service and robots.txt file to ensure ethical data collection practices. We extracted key information such as book titles, authors, ratings, and the total number of ratings, which serve as crucial factors in our recommender engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset serves as a basis for part of our recommendation logic: if a user's input matches a title within this up-to-date list, our system is designed to recommend a book from this subset, thereby providing suggestions that are in line with current reading trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for the web scraping process, as well as the initial data inspection and cleaning procedures, can be found in the notebook titled \"1. Data Import and Inspection\". This notebook details the step-by-step methodology employed in extracting the dataset, the structure of the scraped data, and the initial exploratory data analysis performed to understand the dataset's characteristics.\n",
